# Histograms Interpretation

- fixed_acidity

Distribution: Bell-shaped, slightly right-skewed.
Most values: Cluster around 6–8 g/L.
Insight: Fairly normal distribution with few wines on the acidic extremes.

- volatile_acidity

Distribution: Right-skewed.

*Summary*

Several variables are right-skewed: residual_sugar, chlorides, volatile_acidity.
pH, total_sulfur_dioxide, and fixed_acidity are reasonably normally distributed.
alcohol content is evenly spread, indicating good variability.
Most wines are of average quality (5–6) with relatively few very poor or excellent scores.

Median: ~2 g/L.
Range: 0–5.
Outliers: Many outliers above 10, some reaching 60.
Insight: Extreme outliers — a handful of very sweet wines.

- chlorides

Median: ~0.07.
Range: 0.03–0.1.
Outliers: Frequent above 0.1 to 0.3.
Insight: Most wines have low chloride, but many high outliers.

- free_sulfur_dioxide

Median: ~30 mg/L.
Range: 5–60.
Outliers: Many above 80–200.
Insight: Heavy use of sulfur dioxide in some wines.

- total_sulfur_dioxide

Median: ~120.
Range: 50–200.
Outliers: Several beyond 250–400.
Insight: Notable for wines with very high preservative levels.

- density

Median: 0.995.
Range: 0.99–1.0.
Outliers: Few above 1.0–1.04.
Insight: Tight clustering around typical wine density.

- pH

Median: ~3.2.
Range: 2.9–3.4.
Outliers: Present on both lower (2.8) and higher (3.6–3.8) ends.
Insight: Wines typically mildly acidic.

- sulphates

Median: ~0.5.
Range: 0.3–0.7.
Outliers: Notable above 0.8–1.0.
Insight: Most wines have moderate sulphate levels; some elevated.

Outliers: A few above 12.5–14%.
Insight: Good variation; most wines cluster around the median.

*Summary*

Right-skewed variables (like residual_sugar, free_sulfur_dioxide, total_sulfur_dioxide, chlorides) have multiple high outliers.
Symmetric or near-normal variables: fixed_acidity, pH, density.
Moderate spread variables: volatile_acidity, citric_acid, sulphates, alcohol.
Potential for log transformation: residual_sugar, total_sulfur_dioxide, and chlorides before ML modeling to reduce skew and improve performance.


# Correlation Heatmap interpretation

Correlation values range from -1 to +1:
+1 = Perfect positive correlation
-1 = Perfect negative correlation
0 = No linear correlation

- Strong Positive Correlations:

Free sulfur dioxide ↔ Total sulfur dioxide: 0.62
Expected, as free SO₂ is a part of total SO₂.

Residual sugar ↔ Density: 0.84
High sugar content increases liquid density — perfectly logical for wine.

Total sulfur dioxide ↔ Density: 0.53
Wines with more preservatives also tend to be denser.

Alcohol ↔ Quality: 0.44
Strongest positive correlation with wine quality.
Suggests higher alcohol wines tend to be rated better.

- Strong Negative Correlations:

Density ↔ Alcohol: -0.78
As alcohol content rises, wine density decreases — because alcohol is less dense than water.

pH ↔ Fixed acidity: -0.43
Higher acidity = lower pH — textbook acid-base chemistry relationship.

Alcohol ↔ Residual sugar: -0.45
Drier wines (less sugar) generally have higher alcohol (fermentation consumes sugar).

Alcohol ↔ Total sulfur dioxide: -0.45
Higher alcohol wines tend to have lower SO₂, possibly as alcohol itself acts as a preservative.

- Weak or Insignificant Correlations:

Quality with most other features is weakly correlated:
Chlorides ↔ Quality: -0.21
Volatile acidity ↔ Quality: -0.19
Total sulfur dioxide ↔ Quality: -0.17
Suggests wine quality depends on a complex combination of factors, with no single overwhelming predictor besides alcohol.

- Quality rating analysis:

Predominance of Average Ratings:
The majority of wine samples in the dataset received a quality rating of 6, indicating that most wines fall within an average quality range.

Limited High-Quality Wines:
Ratings of 9 were observed but were relatively rare, and no wine received the highest possible rating of 10.

Scarcity of Low Ratings:
Lower ratings, specifically 1 and 2, were either entirely absent or extremely infrequent, suggesting that extremely poor-quality wines were not present in the dataset.

Moderate Distribution Range:
The quality scores were generally clustered between 4 and 7, indicating a moderate distribution of wine quality with limited representation at the extremes.

Implication for Dataset Bias:
This distribution pattern reflects a possible sampling bias or a quality control tendency in wine production, where very poor and extremely high-quality wines are less commonly produced or sampled.
